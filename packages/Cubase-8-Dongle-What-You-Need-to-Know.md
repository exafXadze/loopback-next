- How can I get a second dongle or license for Cubase 8?
- Is there a way to crack or bypass the dongle protection?

In this article, we will try to answer these questions and provide some useful tips and resources for Cubase 8 dongle users.
  
## Can I use Cubase 8 on multiple computers with one dongle?
 
The answer is yes, but not at the same time. You can install Cubase 8 on as many computers as you want, but you can only run it on one computer at a time by plugging in the dongle. If you want to switch to another computer, you need to quit Cubase 8 and move the dongle to the other computer. This way, you can use Cubase 8 on different machines without buying multiple licenses[^1^].
  
## What happens if I unplug the dongle while Cubase 8 is running?
 
The answer is simple: Cubase 8 will stop responding and crash. This is because the software constantly checks the presence of the dongle and its license code. If the dongle is removed or disconnected, the software will lose its authorization and terminate. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you do not unplug the dongle while Cubase 8 is running[^2^].
  
## How can I get a second dongle or license for Cubase 8?
 
If you want to run Cubase 8 on two computers at the same time, or if you want to have a backup dongle in case of loss or damage, you need to buy a second license for Cubase 8. Unfortunately, there is no special deal or discount for buying a second license. You have to order a completely new license from the Steinberg shop system[^1^]. Alternatively, you can transfer one of your existing licenses (such as WaveLab Elements) to a new dongle and use it on a separate computer[^3^].
  
## Is there a way to crack or bypass the dongle protection?
 
The answer is no. There is no reliable or safe way to crack or bypass the dongle protection of Cubase 8. The dongle encryption and verification are very sophisticated and secure. Any attempt to tamper with the dongle or the software may result in malfunction, corruption or legal consequences. Moreover, using cracked or pirated software may expose your computer to viruses, malware or hackers. Therefore, it is strongly advised that you do not download or use any illegal or unofficial versions of Cubase 8[^4^].
  
### Conclusion
 
Cubase 8 is a powerful and versatile DAW software that requires a USB dongle to run. The dongle serves as a proof of ownership and authorization for the software. However, some users may encounter some questions or issues regarding the dongle, such as how to use it on multiple computers, what to do if it is unplugged, how to get a second one or whether it can be cracked. In this article, we have tried to answer these questions and provide some useful tips and resources for Cubase 8 dongle users.
