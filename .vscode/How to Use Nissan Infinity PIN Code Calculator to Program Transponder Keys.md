# How to Use Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator to Program Transponder Keys
 
If you need to program a new transponder key for your Nissan or Infiniti vehicle, you may need a PIN code to access the immobilizer system. The PIN code is a 4-digit number that is unique to each vehicle and can be found on some labels inside the car. However, if you don't have the label or can't read the code, you can use a Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator to generate the code from other information.

A Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator is a software tool that can calculate the 4-digit PIN code for various Nissan and Infiniti models by using the serial number of the immobilizer unit (also known as ICU, IMMU, SEC or BCM). The immobilizer unit is a device that prevents the engine from starting without the correct key. It communicates with the transponder chip inside the key and verifies its code.
 
There are different types of immobilizer units and different versions of NATS (Nissan Anti-Theft System) or IVIS (Infiniti Vehicle Immobilizer System) that require different methods of calculating the PIN code. You need to identify the type and version of your immobilizer unit before using the Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator.
 
One way to identify the immobilizer unit is by checking the label on it. The label may have a barcode, a serial number, a date code, an origin code and an encrypted code. Depending on the type and version of the immobilizer unit, you may need one or more of these information to calculate the PIN code.
 
Another way to identify the immobilizer unit is by checking the label on the ICU (Immobilizer Control Unit), which is usually located under the dashboard or behind the glove box. The ICU label may have a STEP number that indicates the NATS version. For example, STEP-5 means NATS-5, STEP-5.6 means NATS-5.6, and so on.
 
Once you have identified your immobilizer unit and its information, you can use the Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator to generate the PIN code. You need to enter the required information into the software and click on "Calculate". The software will display the 4-digit PIN code that you can use to program your transponder key.

This version can calculate PIN codes for NATS 5 and NATS 6 by using the encrypted code from ICU or SEC labels[^2^] [^3^]. For other types and versions of immobilizer units, you may need a different version of Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator or another tool.
 
To program your transponder key, you need to follow the instructions of your key programmer device. You may also need to perform some procedures on your vehicle, such as inserting and turning the key in the ignition switch, pressing some buttons or pedals, etc. The exact steps may vary depending on your vehicle model and year.
 
Nissan Infinity PIN Code Calculator is a useful tool for locksmiths, car owners and mechanics who need to program transponder keys for Nissan and Infiniti vehicles. It can save time and money by avoiding going to a dealer or buying a new immobilizer unit. However, it is important to use it correctly and responsibly, as it may not work for all vehicles or situations.
